# Awesome Intelligence AI

Welcome! I have been wanting to do this project for a while. We are going to call it "Awesome Intelligence AI" - a conversational AI assistant built to provide intelligent, context-aware responses and interactions, powered by **GitHub Models API**.

## Overview

This project implements a modern chat-based AI system with a beautiful web interface and robust backend. The AI leverages GitHub Models (including GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Mistral) to deliver helpful, accurate, and engaging conversations in real-time. More updates and features will be added later, but right now we are making a simple AI chatbot.

## ✨ Features

- **GitHub Models Integration**: Powered by multiple AI models (GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, Mistral)
- **Modern Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design that works on all devices
- **Real-time Chat**: Fast and fluid conversation experience
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains conversation history for relevant responses
- **Highly Customizable**: Extensive comments throughout code for easy customization
- **RESTful API**: Well-structured backend with Express.js
- **Session Management**: Automatic conversation tracking and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and recovery
